## Simple Summary

The Zioncoin federation protocol maps Zioncoin addresses to more information about a given user. It’s a way for Zioncoin client software to resolve email-like addresses such as `name*yourdomain.com` into account IDs like: `GCCVPYFOHY7ZB7557JKENAX62LUAPLMGIWNZJAFV2MITK6T32V37KEJU`. Zioncoin addresses provide an easy way for users to share payment details by using a syntax that interoperates across different domains and providers.

## Specification

Zioncoin addresses are divided into two parts separated by `*`, the username and the domain.

For example: `bob*zioncoin.org`:

* `bob` is the username,
* `zioncoin.org` is the domain.
The domain can be any valid RFC 1035 domain name. The username is limited to printable UTF-8 with whitespace and the following characters excluded: `*` ,`>` Although of course the domain administrator can place additional restrictions on usernames of its domain.

Note that the `@` symbol is allowed in the username. This allows for using email addresses in the username of an address. For example: `maria@gmail.com*zioncoin.org`.

## Federation Request

You can use the federation endpoint to look up an account id if you have a zioncoin address. You can also do reverse federation and look up a zioncoin addresses from account ids or transaction ids. This is useful to see who has sent you a payment.

Federation requests are HTTP GET requests with the following form:

`?q=<string to look up>&type=<name,id,txid>`

Supported types:

* `name`: returns the federation record for the given Zioncoin address. Example request:
`https://FEDERATION_SERVER/federation?q=bob*zioncoin.org&type=name`
* `forward`: Used for forwarding the payment on to a different network or different financial institution. The other parameters of the query will vary depending on what kind of institution is the ultimate destination of the payment and what you as the forwarding anchor supports. Your `zioncoin.toml` file should specify what parameters you expect in a forward federation request. If you are unable to forward or the other parameters in the request are incorrect you should return an error to this effect. Example requests:
  * `https://FEDERATION_SERVER/federation?type=forward&forward_type=bank_account&swift=BOPBPHMM&acct=2382376`
  * `https://FEDERATION_SERVER/federation?type=forward&forward_type=remittance_center&first_name=Jhun&last_name=Matahari&address=17A%20Sales&city=Angeles&postal_code=12121&country=PH&mobile=0911111112` if more information needs to be sent through
* `id`: returns the federation record of the Zioncoin address associated with the given account ID. In some cases this is ambiguous. For instance if an anchor sends transactions on behalf of its users the account id will be of the anchor and the federation server won’t be able to resolve the particular user that sent the transaction. In cases like that you may need to use txid instead. Example: https://YOUR_FEDERATION_SERVER/federation?q=GD6WU64OEP5C4LRBH6NK3MHYIA2ADN6K6II6EXPNVUR3ERBXT4AN4ACD&type=id
* `txid`: returns the federation record of the sender of the transaction if known by the server. Example:
`https://YOUR_FEDERATION_SERVER/federation?q=c1b368c00e9852351361e07cc58c54277e7a6366580044ab152b8db9cd8ec52a&type=txid`

## Federation Response

The federation server should respond with an appropriate HTTP status code, headers and a JSON response.

You must enable CORS on the federation server so clients can send requests from other sites. The following HTTP header must be set for all federation server responses.
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

When a record has been found the response should return `200 OK` HTTP status code and the JSON body with following fields:

* `zioncoin_address` - zioncoin address
* `account_id` - Zioncoin public key / account ID
* `memo_type` - [optional] type of memo to attach to transaction, one of `text`, `id` or `hash`
* `memo` - [optional] value of memo to attach to transaction, for `hash` this should be base64-encoded. This field should always be of type `string` (even when `memo_type` is equal `id`) to support parsing value in languages that don't support big numbers.

Example:
```json
{
  "zioncoin_address": "bob*zioncoin.org",
  "account_id": "GCIBUCGPOHWMMMFPFTDWBSVHQRT4DIBJ7AD6BZJYDITBK2LCVBYW7HUQ",
  "memo_type": "id",
  "memo": "123"
}
```

If a redirect is needed the federation server should return `3xx` HTTP status code and immediately redirect the user to the correct URL using the `Location` header.

When a record has not been found `404 Not Found` HTTP status code should be returned.

Every other HTTP status code will be considered an error. The body should contain error details:
```json
{
   "error": "extra details provided by the federation server"
}
```

Federation responses should not be cached. Some organizations may generate random IDs to protect their users’ privacy. Those IDs may change over time.
